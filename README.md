Watch how our planets interact with one and other. This is a basic simulation of our solar system using physics and also displays current astronauts in space and their names by connecting to an API. These API'S are public so feel free to use them!

## What I learned
- Requests
- Application of highshool physics
- wheretheiss API
- open-notify API


This project taught me how to implement some basic highschool physics learned with how large bodies interact with each other. I also learned how to work with a space API where I could fetch data on how many people are in space. I was also able to become more comfortable with Pythons "requests" module.
